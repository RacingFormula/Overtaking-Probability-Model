# Overtaking-Probability-Model
## Overview

The Overtaking Probability Model is a simulation framework designed to predict the likelihood of overtakes in motorsport events. By accounting for factors such as car performance, track characteristics, driver skill, and race conditions, this tool provides insights into overtaking dynamics and strategy planning.

## Features

- **Car Performance Modelling**: Simulates speed differentials and acceleration capabilities.
- **Track-Specific Analysis**: Evaluates overtaking opportunities based on track layout and corner characteristics.
- **Driver Skill Impact**: Incorporates driver aggressiveness and defensive ability.
- **Scenario Simulations**: Models overtaking likelihood under varying race conditions.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Provides detailed plots of overtaking probabilities and key influencing factors.
